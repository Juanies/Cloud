[ELS] Los Santos PD Mega-Pack (LAPD)
Build 210901-1106

This is a remastered version of the LAPD pack I released back in late 2020. This version includes some new vehicles and remastered versions of others. The FPIS (police3) does not have the partition collision feature because I lost the modeling file for it a very long time ago.

A note on the handling lines
They are designed to be as realistic as possible. This means:
- Actual top speeds (some exceeding 150 MPH)
- Increased acceleration ability
- Significantly reduced braking abilities
- Significantly reduced cornering abilities
- Significantly increased body weight
- These go best when used with Killatomate's Realistic Driving V mod - which my handling lines are based off of
- If installing both, you'll need to do some modifications to the handling.meta file - instructions to come
- These take some getting used to, especially if you've been using the vanilla GTA V handling this entire time.
- Vanilla handling versions of this pack are included within the download, in the Optionals folder.Â 

Known bugs:
- Hands not on steering wheel for the 2014 FPIU (police71)
- DashcamV offsets are missing for a couple of vehicles

Known accuracy issues:
- Unmarked and K-9 vehicles are missing the puck antenna on the passenger side roof
- For vehicles with a shotgun, it's mounted incorrectly
- Arjent takedowns should individually flash at stage 3, but I can't implement this due to ELS limitations and was unable to get non-ELS to work properly
